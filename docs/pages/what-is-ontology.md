## What is Ontology

Ontology is the study of “what exists” and the relationships between different kinds of existence. It can mean slightly different things depending on context:

### Philosophy

In philosophy, ontology is a branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature of being, existence, and reality. It asks:
	- What kinds of things exist? (e.g., numbers, minds, matter, time, universals, etc.)
	- How are these things grouped and related?
	- What does it mean to be?

For example, an ontological question is: “Do abstract objects like numbers really exist, or are they just human inventions?”

### Computer Science / Information Systems

In computing and AI, an ontology is a structured way of representing knowledge about a domain. It usually consists of:
	- Entities (or concepts): e.g., Person, Car, City.
	- Attributes: e.g., a Person has a name, age.
	- Relationships: e.g., a Person lives in a City.

Ontologies make data machine-readable and interoperable, often used in the Semantic Web, knowledge graphs, and AI reasoning.

### Everyday Use

Sometimes people use “ontology” more loosely to mean “the set of categories and relationships we use to describe a system or worldview.”
