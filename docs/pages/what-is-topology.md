## What is Ontology

Topology is about how entities are connected or arranged. It can mean slightly different things depending on context:

## Philosophy & Mathematics
In mathematics, *topology* studies the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations (stretching, bending, twisting — but not tearing or gluing).  
It asks:  
- What makes one shape essentially the same as another?  
- When do two objects share the same “form,” even if they look different?  

Example: a coffee mug and a donut are topologically the same (both have one hole).  

Philosophically, topology is about **spatial relations** and **connectedness** rather than substance. It focuses on *how things are arranged or related in space*, not on *what they are*.  


## Computer Science / Information Systems
In computing, topology usually means the **arrangement of components and their connections**.  
Examples:  
- **Network topology**: how computers or nodes are connected (star, mesh, ring, tree).  
- **System architecture topology**: the layout of modules, APIs, databases, etc.  

Here, topology doesn’t care about the *content* but about the *structure of connections*.  

## Everyday Use
In casual language, “topology” can mean the *map* or *layout* of things in relation to each other.  

Example: “the topology of a city” could mean how roads and neighborhoods are connected.
